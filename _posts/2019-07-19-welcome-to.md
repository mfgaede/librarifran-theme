One of my all-time favorite and most-played games, <em>Welcome To</em> got a bunch of themed holiday expansions. This is a great game for work board game lunches, since it scales to as many players as needed. It has a few concepts that need to be played to be understood (see: bis, winning strategies), but I've literally never had a player not want to play it again or want to purchase it themselves. Evergreen.
