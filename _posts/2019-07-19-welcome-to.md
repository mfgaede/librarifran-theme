<p>one of my all-time favorite and most-played games, <em>welcome to</em> got a bunch of themed holiday expansions. this is a great game for work boardgame lunches, since it scales to as many players as needed. it has a few concepts that need to be played to be understood (see: bis, winning strategies), but i've literally never had a player not want to play it again or want to purchase it themselves. evergreen.</p>
