We lived in an apartment a few blocks away from the university of arizona that had been previously occupied by the owner of the complex. we were given permission to paint, including the cabinets! this photo is a small memento of our customization.

The living room was an avocado green, the bedroom a dusty mauve, and the office a cozy brown. i have very fond memories of this apartment, where we took the doors off a shallow closet and turned it into a built-in bookcase and put our television into it as well.
