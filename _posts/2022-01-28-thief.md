I have a Lucas story.

Last night, in the interest of comfort, I took my earrings off while lounging on the couch. I forgot them on the coffee table when I went to bed. The next morning, one of them was on the blanket on the couch.

Thinking that I must have dropped it while bringing my phone and water bottle to bed, I set it on the coffee table while I look for the other. Lucas jumps up on the coffee table, announcing himself with a little “mrrt,” like he does, loops a paw through the hoop of my earring, and runs under the couch with it.

He leaves the the earring under the couch and slinks off insouciantly, I still haven’t found the missing one, and I pull a muscle in my neck attempting to retrieve the one I can locate from under the couch.

I really do love this bad cat. But he sure is awful bad.

P.S. He also stole my Cheetos at dinner.

P.P.S. Kyle just recovered the under-the-couch earring and found the missing one. Absolute hero.
