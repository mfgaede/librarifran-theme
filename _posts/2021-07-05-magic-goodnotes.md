I began drafting this post in my first digital planner, which I purchased after working with GoodNotes for several years and window shopping for said digital planner for nearly as long. I finally found and miraculously settled on the [DashPlanner](https://thedashplanner.com/), which hit the sweet spot of price, design, and features. But that’s another post!

On July 2, I received a newsletter from Megan Dillard, the designer-entrepreneur behind DashPlanner, with the coolest sheet of color-changing stickers. I immediately played with them, checked if this was a new GoodNotes feature (it was not), tweeted about them, and set about replicating them. I tried changing the color of existing transparent stickers I had created from PNGs, but was unsuccessful. My text stickers changed color, but that was nothing new.

I traced over a couple of my aforementioned image-based transparent stickers with the pen tool in GoodNotes and, for a solid sticker, colored it in. The results were, uh, fine, I guess? But it was certainly time intensive and not as slick as the lovely options shared by Megan. At this point, though, it was 3 AM, my hand was a little sore, and insomnia tugged me elsewhere for another hour until I fell asleep.

Then, last night, during yet another bout of insomnia, I found a GoodNotes user similarly enchanted with these magical, color-changing stickers. [/u/StefyF documented a similar attempt at replication to my own](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodNotes/comments/ocyfyd/changing_elements_color_in_goodnotes/) and linked to the [GoodNotes July Round-Up](https://medium.goodnotes.com/digital-stickers-goodnotes-10a55a2aa98b) that included [several premium sets of color-changing stickers](https://www.etsy.com/de/shop/WidescreenEducation?section_id=33393421) by WidescreenEducation. [/u/ShrkB8ter](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodNotes/comments/ocyfyd/changing_elements_color_in_goodnotes/h4198c7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) noted that only certain features within the application can use the color-changing editor: writing (the pen tool), the highlighter, and, as I’d previously noted but dismissed as boring, the text tool. Apologies for the backstory, I know everyone just wants the instructions, but credit goes where credit is due.

The text tool is key to creating color-changing stickers, and here’s an easy way to do it. What you need:

[AnyFont](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anyfont/id821560738) ($2.99) or your preferred method to install custom fonts on your iPad

[Font Awesome for the Desktop](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-desktop/setup/getting-started) (Free with a premium version available but unnecessary)

There are many other icon fonts available! See also [IcoFont](https://icofont.com/) or anything you like from [the Dingbats category](https://www.dafont.com/mtheme.php?id=7) from Dafont. This tutorial will proceed using the Font Awesome font, since it has many icons available and is a little different to use from traditional fonts.

If you have not used AnyFont to install a font before, here is a short video from the developer. It was filmed on an iPhone, but the process is the same on an iPad:

Once you install the font, you’ll go back to GoodNotes and enter the name of the icon wrapped in single colons. You can see this demonstrated in this video:

{% include video id="o8YPSdE4ZoQ" provider="youtube" %}

You will note that the icon did not convert from text to icon until I changed it from Font Awesome Regular to Font Awesome Brand. You can check which font each icon uses through the facets available on the Font Awesome website: [Solid](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=listing&p=1&s=solid&m=free), [Regular](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=listing&p=1&s=regular&m=free), [Brand](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=listing&p=1&s=brands&m=free); there are categories and a search function to find what you’re looking for.

I will cover creating a custom font in a future post, since that’s rather more complicated and because, well, I mentioned at the beginning that I started drafting this post in GoodNotes. I didn’t finish drafting it there because my beloved iPad had to go in for service; it was being finicky about charging. I’m so lonesome.
