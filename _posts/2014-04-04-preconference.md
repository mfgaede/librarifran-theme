## My Day

{% include figure image_path="/assets/img/isl_stairway.jpg" %}

I had a marvelous time presenting the [2014 Preconference Workshop](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009184847/http://www.inarchivists.org/meetings/files/2014AnnualMeeting.php) for the Society of Indiana Archivists at the Indiana State Library this afternoon with my dear friend and colleague [Amanda Starkel](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009184847/https://twitter.com/adstarkel), the [Information Commons](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009184847/http://www.butler.edu/information-commons/) and eLearning Librarian at Butler University. The topic of our presentation was Wikipedia for Archivists and covered the basics of Wikipedia editing, licensing, and community standards for GLAM professionals. The LibGuide from which we presented can be found at [Butler LibGuides](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009184847/http://libguides.butler.edu/siaworkshop14) and includes dozens of resources for the beginning information professional Wikipedian.

## Friday Link Round-Up

Workshop preparation left me little time for keeping up with my favorite RSS feeds this week, so I spent a lovely and quiet Friday night catching up.
