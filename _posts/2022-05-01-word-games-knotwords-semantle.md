i love word games! one wordle puzzle a day isn't enough, so i'm always on the lookout for more. 

*[knotwords](https://playknotwords.com/)* is a super fun mix between a crossword and logic puzzle — arrange the letters so every word is valid. available on ios, android & steam. zach gage makes awesome games! his *[good sudoku](https://www.playgoodsudoku.com/)* is a particular favorite.

*[semantle](https://semantle.com/)* is a fascinating word-guessing game where you’re trying to get to the secret word based on feedback on how semantically similar your guess is to that word. there’s no limit to how many guesses you get and there are hints available. it took me 65 guesses & i didn’t use hints — this was linked by *[recomendo](https://www.recomendo.com/)*, one of my favorite weekly newsletters.
