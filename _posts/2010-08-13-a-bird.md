<figcaption><a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/05/sneaky-hate-spiral.html">Allie Brosh - Hyperbole & a Half: The Sneaky Hate Spiral</a></figcaption>

One of the single best descriptions of human emotion I have ever read, with evocative, perfect illustrations rendered simply, but not simplistically, in Microsoft Paint. This is pure empathy for the experience of frustration â€” with the honest truth that the person on which said anger / frustration is vented is rarely if ever the person toward whom it is directed. If it even is a person.

Her books <em>Hyperbole and a Half</em> and <em>Solutions and Other Problems</em> are both on my shelves and worth owning.
