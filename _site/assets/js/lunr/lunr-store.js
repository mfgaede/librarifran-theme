The topic of our presentation was Wikipedia for Archivists and covered the basics of Wikipedia editing, licensing, and community standards for GLAM professionals. The LibGuide from which we presented can be found at Butler LibGuides and includes dozens of resources for the beginning information professional Wikipedian.   Friday Link Round-Up   Workshop preparation left me little time for keeping up with my favorite RSS feeds this week, so I spent a lovely and quiet Friday night catching up.   Libraries   Vatican Library to Go Digital - 1.5 million pages being contracted out to NTT Data out of Japan.   Mysterious coded messages at university library: Professor Mike Moffatt at Western University and university librarians have discovered 16 coded messages in various books around the library. The code has yet to be broken!   Burned Paper Nails Tutorial (via Boing Boing): Something fun for the next Banned Books Week. (This year’s celebration will be September 21-27)   Technology   Unless companies pay, their Facebook updates reach 6 percent of followers: We’ve had a lot of trouble with this at the library - engagement has been much more successful on Twitter!   MetaPhone: The Sensitivity of Telephone Metadata - Interesting research out of Stanford demonstrating how telephone metadata can contain personally identifiable information.   Bring Back Forum, Recipe, Local, and More to Google Search - Also search for blogs and patents with these URL strings. I remember finding recipe search useful when we were doing “Recipe Roulette” in Perspectives on Information.   The Best Tools and Apps to Make the Most of Flickr - From editing to uploading to curation, these tools and applications improve the Flickr experience. Don’t forget to check out the comments for more suggestions. One notable omission: TinEye Multicolr Search.   Habit List - Combining a traditional to-do list with the Seinfeld Productivity Method (“don’t break the chain,”) this beautifully-designed iOS app is quite unique in the ecosystem of to-do apps. $2.99 in the App Store.   Art   Zack Seckler: Aerial Abstracts (via Miss Moss) - Beautiful aerial photographs of flora and fauna in Botswana.   []’Nevermore’ Forevermore: Bringing Edgar Allan Poe Back to Boston] (via My Modern Met) - Statue of Edgar Allen Poe by Stefanie Rocknack. See initial carving in wood at her site.   The Gettysburg Address: A Graphic Adaptation - Review of the graphic novel by Cory Doctorow. [http://amzn.com/0061969761]   5 days of TED in one page (via Boing Boing) - I have some mixed feelings about TED as an organization, but I always find their talks interesting. This is a nice infographic from a participant in the TED Big Bang 2014, summarizing her feelings about the event.   News   AT&amp;T to Netflix: if you don’t bribe us to do our job, you’re asking for a “free lunch” - The net neutrality discussion continues to provoke facepalm moments. I like the AT&amp;T Death Star illustration; huzzah for CC BY!   Crowdfunding Novena, the fully open/transparent laptop project - The Internet is abuzz over this open source hardware project. Launched on Crowd Supply, the project is half-funded with 44 days left to go.   History   400,000 Stars (via Boing Boing) - The story of the “women who worked as human computers at Harvard’s observatory” from new-to-me podcast The Memory Palace. Looking forward to making my way through their archives! (Favorite podcast app for iOS, by the way, is Pocket Casts, a universal app well worth the $3.99 price tag, also available for Android)  ","categories": ["work","links"],

        "excerpt":"After seven days in the beautiful city of Portland and a pair of rich, fulfilling conferences, it’s a little anti-climactic to climb into an airplane where keeping your thoughts to yourself is perhaps the kindest thing you can do for your seat-mates. I’m bursting with feelings and ideas and predictions and questions and I’m loathe to interrupt the surely-precious reading time of the man in the aisle seat. He’s enjoying Cheryl Strayed and nibbling on peanuts. I respect that.   This is the first of several posts on ACRL and the Library Publishing Forum, which will probably be short and unified by topic, rather than in any chronological order. Apologies for the lack of narrative, but that’s how I roll.   Since September 2014, when I first started tracking statistics on Twitter, I have posted an average of 30 tweets a month, give or take. I have posted 500 since the beginning of March, most of that in the last week. My colleagues teased me about my inclusion in the list of top tweets from #ACRL2015 and I felt a bit of private glee as I gained over a hundred new followers. I’ve always felt the lure of the livetweet, having been a consumer of hashtags for far-flung conferences I’ll never attend, and the 140-character limit helps me think more critically about my note-taking.   If you attended either conference and got sick of seeing my smirking Twitter avatar clogging up your feed, I apologize profusely. I hope you engaged the mute button and I hope you’ll un-mute me now that I’m returning to my usual smattering of link-sharing and work-life updates.   Instruction for Faculty   I do a lot of one-shots. A lot. In fact, I would go so far as to say that, with a few rare exceptions, all of the instruction I do is in the one-shot format. I get a lot of office visits post-instruction, probably because of my friendly, baby face and repeated exhortations (usually accompanied by jumping up and down) that I want to meet with my students if/when they need further help on their projects, which are usually too far out for my procrastinatory darlings to have begun thinking about them at the time of instruction. (I am not so far removed from being a student myself that I have forgotten this.)   I’d love to do things that are not one-shots, but I am hyper-aware of my faculty’s limited classroom time and the fact that infolit lessons are only really effective when presented at the time of need. Since there is not enough time in the day for me to be able to attend every class in Philosophy, Religion, Classical Studies, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese, not to mention the First Year Seminars and Honors seminars to which I am assigned, and use of our LMS is sporadic (so online embedding is only rarely an option), it seems to me that one of the best things we can do is empower our faculty to incorporate infolit into their teaching.   We have a few faculty on campus who are already there (see these amazing dueling information literacy videos from my amazing allies in the Department of Religion: ), but ACRL drove home for me the fact that there is still work to be done in educating faculty, and perhaps if we buy into a theory of trickle-down infolit-omics, we’ll see our threshold concepts and standards incorporated into the classroom more organically. As librarians, we’re rarely consulted about assignment design—but with a little thought about infolit at inception, we won’t see the kind of assignment I heard about from a colleague at one of the roundtables I attended:   One of the classes in the nursing school assigned a literature review assignment. Their criteria: must be an article written in the last five years with the word “nursing” in the journal title.   Bringing this back around to the scholarly communication issues that occupy most of my days (and nights—open access activism doesn’t take a break when the sun goes down!), a discussion about scholarship as conversation would go a long way toward making the assignment above into a useful endeavor (though annotation/analysis would be even better).   Other opportunities for faculty instruction from ACRL 2015 &amp; LibPub Forum:   Open Access: I, for one, feel like I’ve probably annoyed everyone and their dog with my OA activism on campus, but a number of panels drove home that no matter what level of saturation you think you’ve reached, there’s a hell of a lot more work to do. Whether it’s just pure confusion (Open access? Is that where I put stuff up on the Internet and anyone can edit it?) or misunderstanding (I can’t publish open access because there aren’t any open access journals in my area.), there will always be conversations that need to be had.   ResearchGate &amp; academia.edu: I know a number of IR managers who consider these folks the competition. I don’t. Because if a faculty member is interested enough in people reading her work that she’s willing to post it on one of these sites, then she’s going to be interested in what I can do for her, too. But those of us working in scholarly communication need to be searching these sites for our faculty and use their participation as an opening salvo in a larger conversation about open access and author’s rights. They’re usually pretty receptive to the idea of “If you’re not paying for it, you’re the product being sold,” but I’m not trying to get them to leave. Visibility is visibility. Just let me do your copyright clearance for you, eh?   Working with Small Scholarly Societies: Library publishing programs, no matter how big or small, have a lot to offer the small scholarly society, but the initial conversations can be fraught. Especially once the idea of potentially changing the author agreement comes up. Copyright is a sticking point and I’ve heard variations of the concern that open access work is more prone to plagiarism. The answer, of course, is that plagiarists are bad guys and if they’re going to plagiarize something, they don’t care whether it’s open or closed access or the author of the article signed a non-exclusive license. They’re going to steal it anyway.   Working with Journal Editors: We rely heavily on our faculty champions, our success stories to spread the good word, whether it’s to their colleagues within their schools or departments or to societies or associations they belong to or to the journals they edit. There was a wonderful session at LibPub that offered a model for creating a cross-disciplinary group of editors across campus. This is a unique constituency on campus that might not otherwise interact. Library sponsorship and leadership can engage in stealth (or not so stealth) discussion regarding the scholarly communication issues that keep us up at night. At my institution, we had a meal for journal editors and related stakeholders that was remarkably well-attended considering the epic ice and snow rendering the roads completely disgusting, which led to discussion that is currently shaping our library’s movement into publishing. I think the work we do with early-career faculty and graduate students also plays a major role in shaping the journal editors of today and tomorrow.   Faculty Instruction Discussion   Attendance is tough. There are far too many demands on faculty time, and while my workshops and discussion sessions feel life-changing and vital to me, they’re just the tip of the iceberg of also-really-important programming going on daily at our campuses: diversity initiatives, #ItsOnUs rallies, student art exhibits, invited lectures, committee work, office hours. Especially at a teaching-focused institution like mine, if you’re not actively contributing toward improving the student learning environment (in its many-splendored glory), you’re wasting someone’s time.   Just like we have to link instruction for students to their point of need, so too do we need to reach out to faculty at the appropriate time. Whether it’s during the quiet time of summer when they’re working on research or syllabi and have a moment to consider a new proposition, or when they’ve reached out to you for another reason, or if you run into them in the coffee line, there is a time (and a season) for these discussions. We’ve got to pick our moments.  ","categories": ["work","posts"],

        "title": "The Magic of GoodNotes Color-Changing Stickers",
        "excerpt":"I began drafting this post in my first digital planner, which I purchased after working with GoodNotes for several years and window shopping for said digital planner for nearly as long. I finally found and miraculously settled on the DashPlanner, which hit the sweet spot of price, design, and features. But that’s another post!   On July 2, I received a newsletter from Megan Dillard, the designer-entrepreneur behind DashPlanner, with the coolest sheet of color-changing stickers. I immediately played with them, checked if this was a new GoodNotes feature (it was not), tweeted about them, and set about replicating them. I tried changing the color of existing transparent stickers I had created from PNGs, but was unsuccessful. My text stickers changed color, but that was nothing new.   I traced over a couple of my aforementioned image-based transparent stickers with the pen tool in GoodNotes and, for a solid sticker, colored it in. The results were, uh, fine, I guess? But it was certainly time intensive and not as slick as the lovely options shared by Megan. At this point, though, it was 3 AM, my hand was a little sore, and insomnia tugged me elsewhere for another hour until I fell asleep.     My less-than-lovely attempts at tracing image-based icons. You can laugh; I did!  Then, last night, during yet another bout of insomnia, I found a GoodNotes user similarly enchanted with these magical, color-changing stickers. /u/StefyF documented a similar attempt at replication to my own and linked to the GoodNotes July Round-Up that included several premium sets of color-changing stickers by WidescreenEducation. /u/ShrkB8ter noted that only certain features within the application can use the color-changing editor: writing (the pen tool), the highlighter, and, as I’d previously noted but dismissed as boring, the text tool. Apologies for the backstory, I know everyone just wants the instructions, but credit goes where credit is due.   The text tool is key to creating color-changing stickers, and here’s an easy way to do it. What you need:   AnyFont ($2.99) or your preferred method to install custom fonts on your iPad   Font Awesome for the Desktop (Free with a premium version available but unnecessary)   There are many other icon fonts available! See also IcoFont or anything you like from the Dingbats category from Dafont. This tutorial will proceed using the Font Awesome font, since it has many icons available and is a little different to use from traditional fonts.   If you have not used AnyFont to install a font before, here is a short video from the developer. It was filmed on an iPhone, but the process is the same on an iPad:               Once you install the font, you’ll go back to GoodNotes and enter the name of the icon wrapped in single colons. You can see this demonstrated in this video:               You will note that the icon did not convert from text to icon until I changed it from Font Awesome Regular to Font Awesome Brand. You can check which font each icon uses through the facets available on the Font Awesome website: Solid, Regular, Brand; there are categories and a search function to find what you’re looking for.   I will cover creating a custom font in a future post, since that’s rather more complicated and because, well, I mentioned at the beginning that I started drafting this post in GoodNotes. I didn’t finish drafting it there because my beloved iPad had to go in for service; it was being finicky about charging. I’m so lonesome.     ","categories": ["posts"],

        "title": "Growing Up and Out of World of Warcraft",
        "excerpt":"Content warning: Activision Blizzard suit awfulness; medical trauma.     Me with my first World of Warcraft machine in 2005  “So what do you do in this game?” my mom asked, rolling out the dough for what was probably a coffee cake or maybe a challah.   This struck me as a sort of strange question — what didn’t I do in this game? It was a world of which I’d barely scratched the surface — I’d never seen or played anything like it. I must have asked her to explain what she meant and I never forgot her eminently reasonable explanation.   “It seems like you spend an awful lot of time running around staring at that cat butt.”     After the most traumatic period of my life, we moved into an apartment that became the place I lived the longest. When I think of my childhood home? That’s the place I conjure. My safe place, my reading nook. Shortly after I graduated from high school, the apartments were sold off as condos and we had to move in a real hurry.   I was working full time to try to support us, but in no way could afford rent in Scottsdale, Arizona. A friend of my mom’s offered us a place to stay. She and I shared a room — strength in numbers vs. the alcoholic roommate in his small house. I worked 60 hour weeks at two jobs trying to keep our heads above water. The computer was packed away. My time off was spent either sleeping or spending time with my boyfriend, who was in college out of town.   Eventually, we were able to secure a larger house and I had a room of my own. Stuff stayed in boxes, though, until one weekend when I came home and my room was unpacked, the PC was hooked up, and Petitchou the Mage was ready to login and play. I wept. (Reader, I married him.)       Baby Groot definitely had a crush on Lethns, my resto druid. She was awesome (and could turn into a tree).  I came home from visiting my in-laws and my mom was sleeping. This was not entirely unusual, especially since Thanksgiving, but this was a lot of sleeping even for her. She’d waved me off, though, so I spent the day watching North and South and crying a lot over Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe and missing my husband who’d stayed behind to help with some home improvement projects for his parents who were starting to think about things like retirement and downsizing.   She appeared in the hallway, suddenly, her thinness much more on the gaunt side than usual, though I didn’t observe it then. Hindsight. There was something urgently, oddly, morbidly, wrong. An odd, purplish mark on her neck and chest, streaking across like spilled ink. She was terrified and refused to go to the emergency room and acknowledge its seriousness, so we scheduled an urgent care appointment. They sent us immediately to the ER, do not pass go, do not collect $200. It was a blood clot, in her jugular. The first of many.   Another arrived while we were raiding Highmaul. (I summoned him home. My mom was sick; I was terrified.) Headphones were on and I didn’t hear her, but I heard something and had a feeling. That was the last night she was awake and alert.   I spent the next few days, I couldn’t tell you how many, with her at the hospital in a twilight fugue, reading the blog archives of Alternative Chat, escaping into her cheerful descriptions of of in-game projects and analysis. I sent her an email, beyond grateful for her company.   My mom died in hospice, less than a month after that first clot. Fuck cancer. I don’t remember playing again until Legion. I don’t remember a whole lot, honestly, my world shattered. I think they borrowed that theme for a couple expansions, now that I think of it.       Enforced snuggle break during an evening of Battle for Azeroth  It was the “Warbringer” cinematic that hooked me — the sea shanty was glorious. All these strong, powerful women owning and sparking the fight. I was feeling empowered in real life and was ready to tear it up in game. I was ready to follow my Banshee Queen, my Warchief! (Lethns the Tauren Druid quickly replaced dear Petitchou. Glass cannon not my thing, it turned out. She lives on in beloved memory.) Then — my Queen torched the World Tree and I rerolled.   A punk-ass warrior named Cavtha was born, ultimately becoming a dark iron dwarf with a fiery mohawk and a pair of furious, blazing axes. When my feelings of empowerment waned with days of uncertainty and (still, always, years later) grief, spin-to-win, leaping into battle, badass Cavtha made me feel (though the reins never dropped) invincible.     LGBTQIA+-friendly, nerds &amp; humanists welcome. I was looking for something specific this time, not waiting for a random invite or likely-looking ad in trade chat. I wanted community, kindred spirits, friends to spend time with as the pandemic stretched ever onward.   I never remember adults in my life talking about how difficult — nigh-impossible, really — it is to make friends outside of work and post-college.   My new guildies were amazing. I adored the new expansion. That guild collapsed, unfortunately, but I helped start a new one with many of those great friends. We made something amazing together, moving to a bigger server, recruiting fantastic new players who have themselves become good friends, achieving Ahead of the Curve, and surviving the game’s longest content drought. I was (and am) proud.     “What are you doing for the holiday weekend, Franny?”   We were introducing ourselves to the new boss with the quintessential fun fact, something a bit personal. I’m an “out” gamer — how can I not be, when no one can fail to notice (or comment on) my very cool light-up microphone. They inevitably venture a guess that I’m a podcaster. Perhaps the more obvious hobby for a librarian and maybe I could or should let the assumption stand, but I adore busting stereotypes.   So I told my new grand-boss and the entire management team of the library about the glorious end of the content drought and my plans for three full days of time with my favorite game and my favorite folks. I tweeted at the Blizz team asking for an Archivist title, pretty please? Or maybe even a Librarian title? How perfect would that be with the new Korthia faction?!   The guild piled on Discord to talk about all the new fun stuff, to run new Torghast, to just chat. It was a fab long weekend, especially after I’d been having some tough times with the content drought and my mental and physical health.     Then one night last week, my beloved GM pinged the Discord with a trigger warning.   I glance at trigger warnings, but more because I’m the kind of person who reads spoilers and the last chapter of a book first. I like to know what I’m getting into, rather than out of concern that the trauma of my past might catch me off-guard. (My past is omnipresent.)   My husband was out of town the night I read the 29 page complaint filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing against Activision Blizzard, growing more horrified by the page. No, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. And after Riot, Ubisoft, Rockstar, Projekt Red, Gamergate, and every #MeToo story — I #BelieveWomen — I know AAA video games are a disaster. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and yet… and yet.   This felt personal the way it feels personal when your workplace does something shitty and you have to sign a letter saying, “my dudes, please don’t appeal this to the Supreme Court and gut the Equal Pay Act, kthx” except my affiliation with this game is almost four times the length of my employment and this. This was someone’s life. That the environment was so pervasive, so unbearable, and the company did nothing is outrageous.   And then, this line in their response to the suit:      “It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.”     — Official Activision Blizzard statement to the media    The whole statement is really a piece of work but that particular line sunk it.      It’s this type of unaccountable behavior by drunk harassers and do-nothing corporate suits that’s driving many long-time players out of a game they’ve loved for years.    Sucks, doesn’t it?     I’ve cancelled my subscription before, when I’ve gotten bored or run out of time to play, but this feels different. I always planned to return with a new expansion or a new patch or when life eased up a bit. Maybe Activision Blizzard will acknowledge their problems, apologize, put in the work, clean house, try to repair some of the damage they have caused. I’m heartened by individual employees past and present — their courage, their kindness and their dedication to standing up for those who cannot. So I’ll never say never.   I’m staying in my guild Discord. I’m ordering a guild shirt, with our fabulous mascot. I’m keeping the game channels muted. I hope to be friends with my guildies for the rest of my life. Time to find some new games to play and to take off the nostalgia glasses. I’ll diversify my hobbies.   Who knows? Maybe I’ll start that podcast everyone’s been asking about.

        "excerpt":"     Mother-in-law is a phrase that evokes a feeling, I think, for young women of a certain age. Existential dread, maybe, mortal terror, perhaps. A negative connotation that I always feel the need to preemptively quash. I have to forestall any misunderstanding of this relationship that has been so precious to me and foundational to my transition to adulthood (insofar as such a thing can be said to have taken place) and my development of a sense of self.   Sue Hollingshead was unlike any woman I had and have met. She was fiercely intelligent, incredibly competent, independent, good-humored, generous, patient. She had a family, a career, a chronic illness… the magazines never even talked about that last part when they talked about having it all. But that had been such a big part of my life experience growing up, and it didn’t define hers or her family’s.   And it wasn’t so much that she was kind or thoughtful — because she was both, enormously so. But she was responsible. Not a righteous or boring responsibility but one borne of love, care, duty to family and loved ones — so rare it sounds like something out of fiction or epic poetry.   I feel so lucky to have known her and to have learned from her. My heart hurts to think of years ahead without her. I miss her good advice, her impeccable timing, her encouragement, and mostly, I just miss her.     Sue, I’ll keep after that tall, tall boy of yours. That new kidney is doing a great job so far and I promise we’ll make the most of it.   Thank you for everything. I love you always.     More memories of Sue  ","categories": ["posts"],

        "excerpt":"I’ve wanted a comments system for several years, but Discus has way too many privacy issues and I had a knee-jerk “not GitHub!” to utteranc.es and its ilk.   Last night, I found Cory Zoe’s 5 minute guide to adding BlueSky-powered comments to any website. It, er, took me significantly longer than five minutes to implement, but it is looking and functioning the way I want it to and I think I understand it well enough to be able to explain it to those like me who couldn’t dream of doing this from scratch, but know enough to want to implement it and break it terribly and repeatedly.   First step is to install the library:                  Copy            npm install bluesky-comments   I moved the folder (node_modules) into the assets folder, so now I have my_folder/assets/node_modules.   In my _config.yml file, I turned on comments for posts:                  Copy            defaults:         - scope:             path: \"\"             type: \"posts\"         values:             layout: single             comments: true   And I set my comments provider to “custom”                  Copy            comments:         provider: \"custom\"   In the _layouts/single.html from Minimal Mistakes, comments are located on lines 68-76.

    "excerpt":"## What's Happening in October 2024?    ### Family  My partner Kyle received a kidney transplant in February 2024 after several years on the transplant list because of a genetic kidney condition. I don't think there are words for the gift of life offered by the family of the anonymous donor, but I'm endlessly grateful.  Likewise, there are no words for to describe the loss of Kyle's beloved mother, who passed away from complications of the same genetic disease in May. [I wrote about her in July](https://www.kudoboard.com/boards/xGRD0ThE) and I miss her every day.  ### Home  My garden is in a sorry state right now; I hope to spend a little time in it this fall to get ready for the winter planting season. I've been spending lots of time indoors with my cross stitch; I'm hoping my hyperfixation will allow me more than one hobby at a given time.  ### Work  This summer, I asked to take a step back from my management responsibilities and to join the faculty of the University of Oregon Libraries. My request was graciously granted and I have been building a new role for myself as a Strategic Projects Librarian. I'm serving as the interim subject liaison for the School of Planning, Public Planning, and Management and preparing to teach a credit bearing course for the Digital Humanities minor / Data Science major on the Cultural Analytics track during the Winter 2025 term.  ### Culture  I just finished watching *X-Men'97* and thought it was spectacular. I may or may not be modeling my hair after Storm's, whether physics allows it or no. Also on Disney+ is the atmospheric and delightful *Agatha All Along*. Katherine Hahn can read the phone book and it's entertaining and Joe Locke is so charming I cannot believe it's only his second role.  ## What is this page?  This is a \"now\" page, meant to focus on my priorities and interests at this stage of my life. It's inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), a writer and musician who hosts [a cool webring of /now pages](https://nownownow.com/). ","url": "http://localhost:4000/now/"
