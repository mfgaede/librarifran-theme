<p>I play yellow in board games and adore echinacea flowers in my garden. I spend a lot (<strong>a lot</strong>) of time cross-stitching, although all my finished pieces are rolled up in a cabinet. My wardrobe straddles the line between corporate-goth and lobster-print-pants and my go-to host gift is Dr. Pepper. I have a strong aversion to being late... which is ironic, since I usually am. My Wordle start word is "CRANE."</p>
<p>According to CliftonStrengths, I lead with Influencing: Positivity, Input, Woo, Activator, and Maximizer. I adore connecting with others and learning from them, almost as much as I love the nap I have to take after a long day of socializing. I have rebuilt this website in four static site builders but it's [still in / returned to] Jekyll. This is either a compliment to Jekyll or a testament to my interest in tinkering with things that are already working.</p>
