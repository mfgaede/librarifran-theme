### Notes on Former Defaults - 2024-03-08

âœ… **To-Do**: Digital planner from [Emma Studies](https://emmastudies.com/) (personal): My iPad has been turned into a cross-stitch pattern manager and I have stopped carrying it with me. Not missing it at the moment, but I adore Emma's work and if you're interested in digital planning that is a bit more evocative of physical planning (think fun fonts, stickers, etc.), I'd recommend checking out her work.
