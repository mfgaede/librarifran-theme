## What's Happening in October 2025?  

### Family

I'm gearing up for Halloween, inspired by a DIY costume I found on [Carbon Costume](https://carboncostume.com/snoopy-the-flying-ace/). It was mostly an excuse to add a bomber jacket to my wardrobe and I've accessorized with vintage Snoopy earrings to make it abundantly clear Who I'm Supposed to Be.

### Home

I attended the Pacific Northwest Stitch Summit in September 2025 (Table 21!) and had an amazing time. Finally finished FlossyFoxShop's Night of the Frost Dragon after more than a year and am delighted to send it to its home.

### Work

I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to teach and to work with students in credit-bearing courses and extracurricularly. Teaching has been a bright spot during a very difficult year at the University and the Libraries.

### Culture

In honor of spooky season, I'm listening to Jaime Loftus' [Ghost Church](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ghost-church-by-jamie-loftus/id1619557591), a history and mystery of American spiritualism. I'm several episodes in to *House of Guinness*. Its anachronistic soundtrack keeps me from taking it too seriously, but it's terribly entertaining. Really looking forward to Guillermo del Toro's *Frankenstein*! I never get tired of adaptations of my favorite story. üòç
