## What's Happening in October 2024?  

### Family

My partner Kyle received a kidney transplant in February 2024 after several years on the transplant list because of a genetic kidney condition. I don't think there are words for the gift of life offered by the family of the anonymous donor, but I'm endlessly grateful.

Likewise, there are no words for to describe the loss of Kyle's beloved mother, who passed away from complications of the same genetic disease in May. [I wrote about her in July](https://www.kudoboard.com/boards/xGRD0ThE) and I miss her every day.

### Home

My garden is in a sorry state right now; I hope to spend a little time in it this fall to get ready for the winter planting season. I've been spending lots of time indoors with my cross stitch; I'm hoping my hyperfixation will allow me more than one hobby at a given time.

### Work

This summer, I asked to take a step back from my management responsibilities and to join the faculty of the University of Oregon Libraries. My request was graciously granted and I have been building a new role for myself as a Strategic Projects Librarian. I'm serving as the interim subject liaison for the School of Planning, Public Planning, and Management and preparing to teach a credit bearing course for the Digital Humanities minor / Data Science major on the Cultural Analytics track during the Winter 2025 term.

### Culture

I just finished watching *X-Men'97* and thought it was spectacular. I may or may not be modeling my hair after Storm's, whether physics allows it or no. Also on Disney+ is the atmospheric and delightful *Agatha All Along*. Katherine Hahn can read the phone book and it's entertaining and Joe Locke is so charming I cannot believe it's only his second role.

## What is this page?

This is a "now" page, meant to focus on my priorities and interests at this stage of my life. It's inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), a writer and musician who hosts [a cool webring of /now pages](https://nownownow.com/).
